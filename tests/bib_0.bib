  abstract = {With the intensification of communication in
                  information systems, interest in security has
                  increased. The notion of noninterference is
                  typically used as a baseline security policy to
                  formalize confidentiality of secret information
                  manipulated by a program. This notion, based on
                  ideas from classical information theory, has first
                  been introduced by Goguen and Meseguer (1982) as the
                  absence of strong dependency (Cohen, 1977).
                  ``information is transmitted from a source to a
                  destination only when variety in the source can be
                  conveyed to the destination'' Cohen (1977) Building
                  on the notion proposed by Goguen and Meseguer, a
                  program is typically said to be noninterfering if
                  the values of its public outputs do not depend on
                  the values of its secret inputs. If that is not the
                  case then there exist illegal information flows that
                  allow an attacker, having knowledge about the source
                  code of the program, to deduce information about the
                  secret inputs from the public outputs of the
                  execution. In contrast to the vast majority of
                  previous work on noninterference which are based on
                  static analyses (especially type systems), this PhD
                  thesis report considers dynamic monitoring of
                  noninterference. A monitor enforcing noninterference
                  is more complex than standard execution monitors.
                  ``the information carried by a particular message
                  depends on the set it comes from. The information
                  conveyed is not an intrinsic property of the
                  individual message.'' Ashby (1956). The work
                  presented in this report is based on the combination
                  of dynamic and static information flow analyses. The
                  practicality of such an approach is demonstrated by
                  the development of a monitor for concurrent programs
                  including synchronization commands. This report also
                  elaborates on the soundness with regard to
                  noninterference and precision of such approaches.}
